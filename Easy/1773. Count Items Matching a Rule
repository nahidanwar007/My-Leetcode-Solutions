"""
You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. 
You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.

The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:

    ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
    ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
    ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.

Return the number of items that match the given rule.
